Two-level game using timer and touchinput on android. The point is to bring the ball to the finish line in the allotted time. The ballâ€™s motion logic is to turn off gravity as soon as the player touches the screen and uses a switch to push him to the finish line. There are also traps at the level, in which the level is overloaded.
